stand a ghost of a chance with my host","God, I wish I were leaving","So let's drink a few","Here's looking at you","I swear","Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?","A hundred numbers on my wall","Some with names I sometimes call","I drop a coin and watch it fall","Tryin' to get connected to you","A thousand hours all alone","My softest pillow turns hard as stone","This is the longest night on my own","Lying here thinking of you","Sometimes I shake my head","And laugh to myself","I'd like to start again with somebody else","I'm like a broken toy forgotten on the shelf","Chorus","Baby, I could have been someone","I could have been something","It would have been nothing to die for you","Baby, you're going to need me","You'd better believe me","It would have been easy to die for you","A million memories flood my brain","Drown my sorrow","Kill my pain","Whets my thirst for you again","Just another night to get thru","All my neighbors scream for quiet at my door","Shattered glass and torn up photos on the floor","Well, I couldn't stand to see your pictures anymore","Chorus","These cuts are deep but you plead innocent","Are you hell or are you heaven-sent","You're much to cold to know how much","You meant to me, yeah","A billion tear drops fallen from my eyes","But it's just a joke now","And I'm laughing at your lies","You made me hard as rock and now I realize","Chorus","(Alice Cooper, Rick Boston, Chuck Charric, Damon Johnson)","It looked so good, your perfect plan","You had to get greedy to be the man","Now you're holding the bag,
